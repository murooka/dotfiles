*smartchr* is a Vim plugin to support input several candidates with a single
key, like ess-smart-underscore in Emacs Speaks Statistics -- when user types
"_" key, it inserts " <- " for the first time or it replaces " <- " by "_" for
the second time.  This plugin provides functions to support to define such
key bindings easily.  For example:

	inoremap <expr> _  smartchr#one_of(' <- ', '_')



Requirements:
- Vim 7.1 or later
